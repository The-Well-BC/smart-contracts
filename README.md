# Smart contracts for TheWell
## Contracts

* Note: Make sure you create a .env.local file to use when deploying contracts onto the testnets. Open the .env.local.sample file and use that to create your .env.local file.

`npm run ropsten:migrate` deploys the contracts to the Ropsten testnet network.
